    "list": [
      {
        "question": "Why is access to clean water so important?",
        "answer": "Clean water is essential for life. It prevents the spread of disease, supports hygiene, enables education (especially for girls), and strengthens communities. Without it, daily life is a constant struggle."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does water access improve health?",
        "answer": "Clean water dramatically reduces waterborne diseases like cholera and dysentery, which are especially dangerous for children. Access to sanitation and hygiene saves lives and improves overall well-being."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why should I donate to water projects?",
        "answer": "Your donation provides a basic human need — clean water. It helps build wells, deliver water to homes, and install sanitation systems. Every contribution makes a tangible difference in someone’s daily life."
      },
      {
        "question": "Where does my donation go?",
        "answer": "Your donation directly supports clean water initiatives — including the construction of wells, installation of water systems, and hygiene education in communities facing water scarcity, like in Palestine."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does clean water help women and children?",
        "answer": "Women and children often spend hours each day collecting water. By providing water access closer to home, they gain time for education, work, and family — lifting entire communities out of poverty."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is water distribution a form of sustainable charity?",
        "answer": "Yes. Unlike short-term relief, building water infrastructure creates long-term, self-sustaining change by empowering communities with ongoing access to this vital resource."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can water aid be a valid use for Zakaat?",
        "answer": "If water projects directly benefit eligible recipients — such as the poor, needy, or those in hardship — then Zakaat funds can be used, as guided by scholars and charitable organizations."
      },
      {
        "question": "What regions benefit from my donation?",
        "answer": "Your contribution helps families in areas like Gaza and the West Bank, where clean water is scarce due to conflict, infrastructure damage, and occupation-related restrictions."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I see the impact of my donation?",
        "answer": "Yes, many organizations provide reports, photos, and updates showing how your support is transforming lives through water delivery, well construction, and sanitation programs."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is donating for water considered Sadaqah Jariyah?",
        "answer": "Yes. Providing water is one of the best forms of ongoing charity (Sadaqah Jariyah) — as long as it continues to benefit people, the donor receives rewards even after death."
      }

  "verse": {
    "sentences": [
      "\"And We made from water every living thing...\"",
      "Providing water is not just aid — it’s giving life, hope, and dignity."
